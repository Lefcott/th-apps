# event-management

Caregiver events UI built with Create-React-App (and some helpful routing with [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/))

## Running and developing locally

To run locally, you can either run `yarn start` or `npm start`.

You will likely need a token for development. As long as you have valid k4 credentials you can run the following command to generate your local development token.

```
export REACT_APP_LOCAL_TOKEN=$(./generateToken.sh)
```

## Building for production

Run `npm run build` to build the project
